/**
 * Adapter #10 - OMP's tool-approval dialog (§4.6.4).
 *
 * With a race handle on the entry (§4.12) the dialog is the built-in tool
 * approval behind a raced `ui.approve` call: the answers are the fixed
 * once/session/deny set the method resolves with, so the adapter never looks
 * at the screen.
 *
 * Without a handle the adapter declines. The keys such a dialog answers to are
 * whatever its own legend advertises, and those differ between hosts and
 * versions - reading them out of the drawn frame is gone (§4.6.6 exception 2).
 * A button that presses a key nobody listens for is worse than no button at all,
 * so the snapshot adapter takes over instead, which still leaves the terminal's
 * own keys and the escape hatch.
